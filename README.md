# Midterm FurnitureStore Project

## Description

This is a midterm assignment project based on the FurnitureStore website template.  
The goal of the project is to recreate the layout using the following technologies:

- **HTML** (with semantic structure and meaningful class names)
- **SASS** (structured into separate files and folders by component/section)
- **JavaScript** (structured into functions, avoiding top-level code)

## Requirements Followed

- HTML is written using semantic tags and clean, readable class naming conventions.
- SASS files are organized into a modular structure using separate folders/files (e.g., `layout/`, `components/`, `base/`).
- All styling is written in SASS and compiled into CSS.
- JavaScript code is modular and broken down into reusable functions, avoiding clutter in the global scope.

## Technologies

- HTML5  
- SASS (SCSS syntax)  
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
